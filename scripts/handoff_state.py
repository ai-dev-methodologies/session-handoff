"""One command shared by the /handoff · /resume-handoff pair.

Both commands start with the same bounded state block, so what /handoff writes into
`Session State` and what /resume-handoff compares against come from one source.

Usage:
  python3 ~/.claude/scripts/handoff_state.py <cwd>
      /handoff Step 0+2: state block (user rules file, toplevel, linked worktree, project key,
      previous handoff, history file, project rules file, branch, head, upstream ahead/behind,
      status summary + status file, lockfile-changed, diffstat).
  python3 ~/.claude/scripts/handoff_state.py <cwd> --resume [<arg> ...]
      /resume-handoff Step 0+1: the same state block (without previous handoff, history file and
      diffstat), then a `continue:` line, the handoff file resolved from <arg> (path | YYYY-MM-DD |
      slug | nothing = newest), its age, whether its recorded branch matches the current branch,
      how many commits and files changed since its recorded HEAD, one `live subagent:` line per
      Live subagents item, and the checker result.

The project key is the main worktree of a linked worktree, else the toplevel, else (outside
git) the cwd. Without a path argument, only handoffs whose `**Toplevel:**` line (or, in older
files, the first path of `**Project:**`) equals the project key are candidates. A path argument
is used as given; when its project differs, `continue:` is forced to no.

An argument that is an existing file path is the selector as written, spaces included. The
other arguments are split on whitespace. `--continue`, `--c`, or a token that is exactly
`계속` (surrounding punctuation and quotes removed) sets `continue: yes`. Of the remaining
words, the first date, path, or slug that names a handoff file is the selector; the rest are
reported on one `WARNING: ignored argument words:` line. The handoff body is never evidence
for `continue:`.

In the default mode, when CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID is a UUID, `session id: <id>` and
`transcript: <path | none (not found)>` follow the state block (also outside git); the path is the
newest ~/.claude/projects/*/<id>.jsonl. Without the variable there are no such lines.

In resume mode, when the chosen handoff's head carries `**Session:** <UUID>`, that session's transcript
is read again: the messages the user gave it after its last /handoff input that the file's
`## After Handoff` section does not quote make `continue: no (unrecorded messages after handoff)`, even
with `--c`. A `project mismatch` or `newer handoff skipped` reason wins over it, but either way
`WARNING: N user message(s) after the last /handoff are not in the handoff file` and one indented
`「<message>」 (HH:MM:SSZ)` line per message (at most 5, then `… and N more`) follow the `handoff:` line.
When the transcript cannot be judged, `WARNING: after-handoff messages not checked: <reason>` takes that
place and `continue:` is unchanged. A file without the line, or with `none`, prints neither.

That transcript also gives the BEFORE block, printed after those lines and before `handoff age:`:
`before handoff: N user message(s)` and one indented `「<message>」 (HH:MM:SSZ)` line per message the user gave
right before the last /handoff input (the last 5, plus the input's arguments; at most 6). A
`WARNING: N user message(s) before the last /handoff are not in the handoff file` follows when the file's
`## Before Handoff` does not record them all. The block is display only: `continue:` stays what the after-handoff
messages decide, and a checker without these functions prints `checker unavailable` in the not-checked WARNING.
In the default mode the run record's `handoff` field is the `previous handoff:` path.

In the default mode, when ~/.claude/scripts/context_budget.py exists, its `--line` output is
printed as `context-budget: <first line, cut to 200 chars>`. Exit 0 and 2 both count as output
(2 means over budget); any other exit code or empty output prints a `WARNING: context-budget ...`
line instead. The exit code of this script never changes. No file, no line, no warning.

`previous handoff:` is the newest handoff of the project key (a candidate for the new file's
`**Continues:**`). `history file:` is the project's append-only record of closed items,
~/.claude/handoffs/history/<project folder>-<sha1(project key)[:8]>.md, printed with `(exists)` or
`(new)` so the model knows whether to create it or append to it.

`head:` is the short sha of HEAD, or none. In resume mode, when the chosen handoff records a
`- **HEAD:**` commit that exists in this repository, `since handoff: <N> commits · <M> files changed`
follows (N of 10 or more adds a WARNING); an unknown commit prints `since handoff: unknown (commit not found)`.

The changed-file list is written to
~/.claude/handoffs/.state/<toplevel folder>-<sha1(toplevel)[:8]>.status.txt and never printed,
so a resume does not start by paying for a long listing.

`live subagent: <name> -> <state> (<reason>)` judges each Live subagents item from the newest copy of
~/.claude/projects/*/*/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl (or */subagents/, or a `result` that is a .jsonl file),
reading only its last 256 KiB: a final stop_reason end_turn, stop_sequence, max_tokens or refusal is
`returned`; otherwise `running?` while the copy changed in the last 15 minutes, `lost` once `expected-by`
(an ISO time) has passed or it has been still for over 60 minutes, else `running? (idle)`. No copy is
`lost (no transcript)`; an id outside [A-Za-z0-9_.:-] is `unknown (id not usable)`. At most 5 lines.

In resume mode, a file as new as or newer than the chosen one (or, when none is chosen, any file) that
is empty, names no project (Toplevel and Project both missing or placeholders), is not valid UTF-8
while its head (read with errors="replace") names this project or none, or is this project's but has
no usable Exact Next Step is named on a `WARNING: newer handoff skipped (<reason>): <file name>` line
(reason `empty file` · `project unknown` · `not valid UTF-8` · `no usable Exact Next Step`), and
`continue:` becomes `no (newer handoff skipped)` even with `--c`. An undecodable file keeps its
`WARNING: unreadable handoff skipped:` line too. A path argument and files confirmed to belong to
another project are not affected. The checker's `WARNING: handoff file is … KiB` line is left out of
the resume excerpt (a resume cannot shrink the file); the checker's own run record keeps it.

Each kind of WARNING line is capped at 3 lines; the third then says how many more there were.
Every run appends one record to the run log (run_log.py next to this file).

Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 resume found no handoff for this project · 2 usage, or Python older
than 3.9 · 3 checker missing or crashed (a `WARNING: checker ...` line says which) · 4 internal
error (traceback tail on stderr).
Set HANDOFF_CHECKER to use a checker other than check_handoff.py next to this file.
