"""Run log shared by handoff_state.py and check_handoff.py (spec section 12, A12).

Each script run appends one JSON line to <home>/.claude/handoffs/.state/runs.jsonl
so a later session can reconstruct what happened. HANDOFF_LOG overrides the path;
the value "off" disables logging. A handoff file body is never recorded, only its path;
indented stdout lines are dropped and only counted (omitted_lines). The only environment
variables read are CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID (kept only when it is a UUID) and HANDOFF_CALLER (kept
only when it is in CALLERS, and only on a check_handoff.py record); nothing else from the environment
is recorded.
The gate counters (after_handoff_lines, before_handoff_lines, before_unrelated, attempt_n, elapsed_ms,
reviews_found, reviews_recorded) hold integers only: any other value is stored as null, so no
message or review text can reach the log through them.
